Created learning journal 

When making the tutorials make them unlinked so that none require a watch of another to understand the statements used. 

Use tutorial tips in Week 2 notes

Basing subject on 3D movement with possible physics based mechanics (gravity)

Week 4 

In this tutorial  I will be presenting how to code simple 3D movement within a space 

First create a new project as a 3D rpoject and name it Move the Cube

After the project has been opened head to the Edit tab at the top left of the screen and go to Project Settings. Here we want to edit what keys trigger movement within the code. Withint Project settings open the sub tab Vertical and remove the primary buttons associated with it. This will ensure that our code does not clash with pre set buttons.

Close the tab and we can begin making our mover.

In the Scene box right click and click 3D Object - Cube to place a cube within our scene. Repeat this with a Plane and place it below our cube. This will be so we can clearly see the ways our cube moves.

Next go to our Folders and create a new Folder called Scripts, this is where we will keep our code that determines how our cube works.
