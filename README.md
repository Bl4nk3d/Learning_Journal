Created learning journal 

When making the tutorials make them unlinked so that none require a watch of another to understand the statements used. 

Use tutorial tips in Week 2 notes

Started making the script for the first tutorial. Decided to make a 3d movement script that moves a cube around a space.

Cube is able move horizontally but collision with objects sends it flying. Will fix next week

29/10/24

Cube's flying issue was solved by locking rotations of the cube in its inspector window.

The movement code felt to stiff for smooth movement and would immediatly change direction when inputs where pressed. 

Going to research how to keep momentum  over movement

5/11/24

Found out how to keep momentum so changed the movement code to use float commands ands use the scenes time to determine speed.

Experimenting with the movement itself I want to add a boost type of button that lets my character move at increased speeds. Like a sprint button

13/11/24

Boost button was added by adding force to the body with its vector and impulses. 

Movement codes tutorials is being written. Will decide the next code next week.

1st tutorials script is now complete and I can begin the next code.
