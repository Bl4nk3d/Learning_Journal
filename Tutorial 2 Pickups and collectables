For the second tutorial I will be explaining how to create simple pickups that can be collected by the player and counted towards a UI count 

First we need to make the pickups themselves

For simplicity we will be making basic coins to collect. In the Heiarchy right click an empty space and create a Cylinder, scale it down using R and rotate it using  the Transform axis in its inspector tab (usually X -90)



No we need to make this look more like a coin in game using its Mesh renderer. Go to the assets folder, create a new folder named Materials right click, go to create and make a new Material

To get that nice gold metal gleam effect, slide the metalic slider up to 1 and then choose an appropriate colour for our coin. I will be using a nice blue for this demo. I like blue :D

Finally drag the new material into the Mesh Renderer Element
