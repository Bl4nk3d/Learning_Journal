For this tutorial we will be making a simple automatic door opening sequence using the Unity Animator functions. This will consist of using Unitys in built animation software to create different forms of the door and animate them accordingly to where the player is located within the immediate vicinity

To begin we need the basis for the door. To do this create a few cubes and rectangles to act as the door and wall or brace that holds the doors. Similar to shown below

Next we need to make the animations for the doors that will open and close. Open up the Animator window if it is not open already. The window can be located as shown here
