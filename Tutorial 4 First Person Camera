For this tutorial I will be making a proper first person camera on a moving player object 

The aim of this tutorial is to make a smooth fully operation firts person perspective of a playe within a scene that can move around and interact with other things in the future.

To begin this tutorial we need to make a new script. Name this script PlayerCam or anything that you will remember.

Afte opening the script we can start adding in the code that will rotate the player and the camera we are seeing through. Firts create two floats for the X and Y sensitivity, a  public transform for the player orientation and two fdloats for the rotation of the camera.
